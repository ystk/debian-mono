      <p>IKVM.NET makes it possible both to develop .NET applications in Java, and to use existing Java API's and libraries
      in applications written in any .NET language. This guide includes information of
      interest to developers who want to use Java as their preferred .NET development language, as well as
      for those who wish to use Java libraries in their C# or VB.NET applications.</p>
