	Add response file suport to Mono.Options.

	Response file support is an "opt-in" feature, performed by adding
	a ResponseFileSource to the OptionSet initialization logic:

	var p = new OptionSet () { // normal options here... new
	ResponseFileSource (), };

	Response files make use of the new "ArgumentSource" support, which
	acts as a low-level argument pre-processor, allowing processing of
	arguments _before_ Option processing is performed.
