	[637935] Fixed 3.5 version of msbuild dlls to reference 3.5
	version of the engine

	MONO_PATH does not work for subsequent dlls, so have to workaround
	it by using full path for dlls in 3.5 profile which does not have
	it's own mscorlib

	* Makefile: Import tools/xbuild/xbuild_targets.make, which copies
	the target and tasks file in the correct place, to allow running
	tests with different toolsversion.
	Use the correct target assembly name for 4.0 profile.

	* Microsoft.Build.Utilities.dll.sources: Add ProcessStringDictionary.cs
	from class/System/System.Collections.Specialized . This is required as
	the StringDictionary in ToolTask, used for EnvironmentOverrides, is
	inadequate, because environment vars are case sensitive on unix.

2009-02-25  Ankit Jain  <jankit@novell.com>

	ProcessWrapper.cs, IAsyncOperation.cs and IProcessAsyncOperation.cs

2005-09-09  Marek Sieradzki  <marek.sieradzki@gmail.com>

	* Microsoft.Build.Utilities.dll.sources: Renamed from
	Microsoft.Build.Utilities.sources.
