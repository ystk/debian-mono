	[wcf] .NET allows for service contract methods to be decorated
	only by Web{Get,Invoke}Attribute

	Usually WCF requires that each service method is marked with the
	OperationContract attribute with the exception of methods
	decorated with the Web{Get,Invoke}Attribute attributes which are
	defined in System.ServiceModel.Web. This patch adds a simple way
	to extend the ContractDescriptionGenerator in order to provide
	this functionality without circular dependency of
	System.ServiceModel on System.ServiceModel.Web. Several extenders
	can be registered with the description generator and they will be
	invoked in the registration order until any of them returns
	'true'. Extenders are passed a reference to the OperationContract
	attribute with which the current method is decorated - if the
	reference is null, the extender should create a default instance
	of the attribute so that the description generator considers the
	method as one to be included in the contract description.

	* WebScriptServiceHostFactory.cs : similarly to ServiceDebugBehavior
	  and ServiceMetadataBehavior in ServiceHostBase, it must *prepend*
	  WebScriptEnablingBehavior to apply all other behaviors subsequently.

	* WebScriptServiceHostFactory.cs : call base.OnOpening() here too.

	* WebScriptServiceHostFactory.cs : I have to again revert the
	  previous change; it does fill endpoints regardless of hosting
	  environment (now with tests).

	* WebScriptServiceHostFactory.cs : do tasks in previous change only
	  if it is done under ASP.NET environment.

2009-09-04  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* WebScriptServiceHostFactory.cs : endpoints are automatically added
	  and if they are added through configuration, it is an error
	  (as documented).

2006-02-16  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* WebServiceHostFactory.cs, WebScriptServiceHostFactory.cs :
	  new files.
