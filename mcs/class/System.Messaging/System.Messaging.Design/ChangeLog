	[Messaging] Conditionally drop dependency on Wnforms

	If you pass the option MESSAGING_NO_WINFORMS=1 to make,
	System.Messaging will be compiled without the dependency to
	System.Windows.Forms. The dependency is needed just by the
	System.Messaging.Design.QueuePathDialog class which is both a stub
	and not used anywhere by Mono.
