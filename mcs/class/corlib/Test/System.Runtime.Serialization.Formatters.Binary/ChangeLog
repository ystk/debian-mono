	version tolerant serialization fails with missing primitive
	members

	Modifies ObjectReader so that when it encounters a primitive typed
	member in an object stream which has no corresponding member in
	the app domain, it will read the value anyway and throw it away.
	That way it can read the next block from the stream.

	Added a unit test which passes with the changes to ObjectReader.

	Fixes bug #641821.

	[corlib] Prevent BinaryFormatter to throw on missing fields

	This commit includes unit tests that were run in MS.NET > 2.0. The
	old behaviour of MS.NET 1.1 is still included in the patch as an
	ONLY_1_1 define, to be backport-friendly to other branches (but
	can be removed from now on in next commits, as mono master doesn't
	include this profile anymore). Fixes BNC#324144.
