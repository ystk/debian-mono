	[asp.net] Rewrote CacheItemPriorityQueue tests generator to
	produce simpler test case.

	The new test case uses arrays and postpones creation of
	CacheItemPriorityQueueTestItem and TestCacheItem instances till
	the actual test is ran. This reduces complexity of the
	CacheItemPrioritQueueTest class constructor and allows the code to
	run successfully on 32 bit machines.

	[asp.net] Added verbose mode to the standalone test runner

	[asp.net] Disabled array clearing on heap resize in
	CacheItemPriorityQueue as it causes NREX to be thrown with > 8192
	items in the queue.

	- Rewrote the CacheItem priority queue test generator to generate
	better code. - CacheItem in System.Web doesn't have the unused
	Guid field now (the field is used only for tests) - Added a huge
	sequence to CacheItem priority queue tests (10k entries)

	* standalone-runner.cs: added new command line parameter, --test,
	which selects a single test to run instead of the entire suite. It
	should be passed a fully qualified (without assembly name) type
	name of the test class.

	* Makefile: added targets to compile cache priority queue tests
	generator and to generate the tests themselves

2010-01-19  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* standalone-runner.cs: reformatted summary message to match
	NUnit's more closely.

	* standalone-runner.cs: added

	* Makefile: added build targets for standalone-runner.exe
