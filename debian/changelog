    (Closes: #728340)
  * [8a07907] There is a bug in the silicon on Loongson 2E and 2F 
    processors, which can cause the traditional NOP instruction 
    (which doesn't exist on MIPS but is an alias to 'sll 0,0,0') 
    to fail intermittently under high load. This is worked around 
    in binutils 
    (https://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/2009-11/msg00387.html) but 
    that only applies to software compiled via binutils, not via a 
    JITter like Mono. The fix uses a different no-op instruction 
    which does not trigger the CPU bug. Thanks to Alex Rønne 
    Petersen for his help.

mono (2.10.8.1-8) unstable; urgency=high

  * [b9108c7] Dirty patch to introduce a new System.Windows.Forms.WebBrowser 
    back-end, which does absolutely nothing. This is to allow applications 
    which create a WebBrowser object to continue to run without crashing, 
    in the absence of a working browser back-end (which we lack right now). 
    This patch is sufficient for 
    http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/CSharp/0460__GUI-Windows-Forms/AsimpleBrowser.htm 
    to run without crashing. (Closes: #683289, #694948)

mono (2.10.8.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * [c934e01] Remove unused File::Basename import from runtime script.
    Having this present causes failures on release upgrades where perl-base
    and perl-modules are not in a consistent state (e.g. this can happen
    when upgrading across major Perl versions). (Closes: #665335) (LP:
    #948848)
  * [9e3cc40] Remove monodoc-base trigger.
    This trigger updated the monodoc search index. It ended up calling
    /usr/bin/monodoc, which is shipped in the monodoc-browser package
    (source package mono-tools). The script attempted to check that
    monodoc-browser was configured, but didn't get this right. This led to
    numerous upgrade failures when Depends of monodoc-browser were not
    satisfied when the trigger was invoked and calling monodoc to update the
    search index bombed out due to this. It's more correct to just have
    monodoc-browser ship this trigger itself. (LP: #972751)

    changes made to 55a1a20a4d858346ed8a8d840abc3f9230ea816e.
    This branch introduced regressions which caused both nant and mono-upnp

  * [61fbbe4] Fix ARM printf format problems.
