Description: Mono runtime
 Mono is a platform for running and developing applications based on the
 ECMA/ISO Standards. Mono is an open source effort led by Novell.
 Mono provides a complete CLR (Common Language Runtime) including compiler and
 runtime, which can produce and execute CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
 bytecode (aka assemblies), and a class library.
 .
 This package contains the Virtual Machine, JIT (Just-in-Time) and
 AOT (Ahead-of-Time) code generator "mono".
 "mono" executes applications for the CLI (Common Language Infrastructure).
 Mono currently only supports the X86, PowerPC, ARM, SPARC, S/390, AMD64 and
 IA64 architectures. Optionally this package configures BINFMT support.

 Mono is a platform for running and developing applications based on the
 ECMA/ISO Standards. Mono is an open source effort led by Novell.
 Mono provides a complete CLR (Common Language Runtime) including compiler and
 runtime, which can produce and execute CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
 bytecode (aka assemblies), and a class library.
 .
 This package contains the Mono.Simd library for CLI 2.0, which provides a
 number of classes that are hardware accelerated by mapping the classes and
 the actual operations to native SIMD instructions on a processor.

Package: mono-xbuild
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${cli:Depends}
Replaces: mono-gmcs (<< 1.2.6-1)
Description: MSBuild-compatible build system for Mono
 Mono is a platform for running and developing applications based on the
 ECMA/ISO Standards. Mono is an open source effort led by Novell.
 Mono provides a complete CLR (Common Language Runtime) including compiler and
 runtime, which can produce and execute CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
 bytecode (aka assemblies), and a class library.
 .
 xbuild is Mono's implementation of msbuild and allows projects that have a
 msbuild file to be compiled natively on Linux.
 .
 Microsoft Build (msbuild) is a build system developed by Microsoft similar in
 spirit to Nant (in that it uses XML files for describing the build process)
 and in the same spirit as make.
