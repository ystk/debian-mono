    + Dropped autoreconf dpatch.
  * debian/control:
    + Updated Vcs-* fields for the migrated git repository.
    + Added new mono-csharp-shell package.
    + mono-devel recommends mono-csharp-shell now (very useful for
      debugging).
    + Added new libmono-management2.0-cil, libmono-messaging2.0-cil,
      libmono-simd2.0-cil and libmono-wcf3.0-cil packages.

      those will be shipped by the moon source package.
    + Removed transition dependencies from libmono1.0-cil, libmono2.0-cil
      mono-devel, as the Mono 2.0 transition has been completed some weeks ago.

    debian/mono-runtime.*:
    + Merged mono-jit, mono-common and libmono0 (except libmono.so.*)
      packages into mono-runtime. libmono0 was pulled in by
      libmono-system2.0-cil as it pinvokes libMonoPosixHelper.so for
      compression stream APIs. Since the interpreter (mint) was dropped long
      time ago and is unmainained upstream, there is no reason to keep those
      3 domains (VM, config / binfmt support, helper libraries) split.
    + Renamed mono-jit-dbg package to mono-runtime-dbg.

    + Moved I18N.dll and I18N.West.dll from libmono-i18nX.Y-cil to
      libmono-i18n-westX.Y-cil, as this is the only code page that is really
      needed in 90% of the cases.

mono (2.0.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Let the show begin!" release
    + Upload to unstable starting the Mono 2.0 transition, status available at:
      http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/DebianMonoGroup/Mono20TransitionTODO
  * debian/control:
    + The compilers (mono-mcs and mono-gmcs) are not forward compatible with
      newer upstream versions, thus added stronger dependencies.
    + Removed libgamin-dev, libcups2-dev, librsvg2-dev, libgtk2.0-dev and
      libgnomeui-dev from build-deps-indep as those packages are only needed
      to generate the debian/shlibs.local file using the
      debian/update-shlibs.local.sh script (the script checks now if those
      are installed). This extended hack is needed as shared-mime-info in
      unstable conflicts with gnome < 2.24 and gnome 2.24 is blocked by
      the Mono 2.0 transition.
  * debian/shlibs.local:
    + Updated using the debian/update-shlibs.local.sh script.

  * debian/mono.links
    debian/mono.postinst
    + Removed, those are just left-overs.
  * debian/mono-jit.postinst:
    + Lowered alternative priority to 10 like all other alternative we install.
  * debian/control:
    + Moved cli-* Provides from mono-1.0-devel, mono-mcs and mono-gmcs to
      mono-devel, as thats where the cli-* alternatives now lives.
    + Added many strong versioned binary dependencies to mono-devel as hack
      to make experimental buildds happy, else everything needing
      mono-devel >= 2.0 will FTBFS in experimental (e.g. KDE4).
      (thanks goes to Modestas Vainius for the investigation)
    + Made dependency on libmono0, libmono-corlib2.0-cil and
      libmono-corlib1.0-cil strong for mono-utils to ensure that the correct
      versions are pulled in (else we might confuse APT or funny buildds).

mono (2.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    + System.Web.Extensions is included in the debian source and binary
      packages now, as JSON.NET was relicensed to MIT/X11 and thus no DFSGing
      needed anymore! (Closes: #497213)
    + With this release, we changed the default development stack from 1.0 to
      2.0. This has no influence to the runtime nor existing binary packages,
      for more details see:
      http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/DebianMonoGroup/Mono20Transition
  * debian/copyright:
    + Updated license info of JSON.NET
  * debian/control:
    + Removed libgda2-dev from buid-deps as debian/update-shlibs.local.sh
      takes already care of it.
    + mono-utils depends on libmono-corlib2.0-cil and only suggests
      libmono-corlib1.0-cil now as the default runtime was changed to 2.0.
    + Updated libcupsys2-dev build-dependency to libcups2-dev.
    + Updated Standards-Version to 3.8.0 (no changes needed).
  * debian/rules:
    + Pass --enable-quiet-build=no to configure call, else we get a less
      verbose build log.
    + Bumped clilibs to 2.0 of libmono{1,2}.0-cil, libmono-cairo{1,2}.0-cil,
      libmono-data-tds{1,2}.0-cil, libmono-system2.0-cil,

      libmono-web2.0-cil, libmono-winforms2.0-cil and libmono-system2.1-cil.
  * debian/mono.runtime-script:
    + Call the script of gacutil instead of passing the application filename
      directly to mono, as we rely on the default gacutil now provided by the
      mono-gac package.

    debian/libmono-getoptions{1,2}.0-cil.install:
    debian/libmono-data{1,2}.0-cil.install:
    + Moved the Mono.Posix, Mono.GetOptions and Mono.Data.* libraries into
      extra packages to support smaller install sizes of typical applications
      (e.g. tomboy or gnome-do).
    + Added libmono-posix{1,2}.0-cil, libmono-getoptions{1,2}.0-cil and
      libmono-data{1,2}.0-cil as dependency of libmono{1,2}-cil to aid a smooth
      runtime transition.

  * debian/patches/build_genxs_2.0.dpatch:
    + Enables compiling genxs for CLI 2.0 as upstream provided a genxs2 script
      but forgot to build the actual application.
  * debian/mono-2.0-devel.install
    debian/mono-2.0-devel.manpages:

    debian/mono-devel.manpages

    + Added gmcs2 script and manpage to mono-gmcs
    + Added mcs1 script and manpage to mono-mcs.
      This changes are needed to get a default compiler target using a single
      package that depends on the current default which is 2.0 (gmcs2).
  * debian/System.Windows.Forms.dll.config:
    + Added dll-map for libgdk_pixbuf-2.0.so
  * debian/control:
    + Improved many package descriptions by adding the names of the
      libraries they contain with a brief description of what they do.
  * debian/control
    debian/mono-gac.install
    debian/mono-{1,2}.0-gac.install:
    + The default script "gacutil" is still shipped in mono-gac but
      "gacutil1" and "gacutil2" are now in mono-1.0-gac and mono-2.0-gac.
      mono-gac pulls in mono-2.0-gac by default.
      This is needed to make a 2.0-only install possible.
  * debian/control:
    + Added mono-1.0-runtime and mono-2.0-runtime package, which pull in the
      runtime stack of the specific runtime version in.
      mono-runtime pulls in mono-2.0-runtime as the new default runtime.
      This is needed to make a 2.0-only install possible.
  * debian/libmono-dev.install:
    + Added dotnet35.pc
  * debian/mono-smcs.install:
    + Added smcs.pc

    debian/mono-1.0-devel.postinst:
    + Moved alternatives handling for cli-sn, cli-resgen and cli-al from
      mono-mcs to mono-1.0-devel, as mono-1.0-devel ships those applications
      (since mono 1.2.6+dfsg-1). (Closes: #460513)
      This caused FTBS for different source packages that didn't explicitly

        with code page definitions, moved from libmono-corlib{1,2}.0-cil.
      - prj2make-sharp, upstream moved distribution of prj2make-sharp to Mono.
    + libmono-corlib{1,2}.0-cil recommends libmono-i18n{1,2}.0-cil now.
    + Removed mono and mono-devel meta packages, as they are not useful for
      anyone.

      - Fixes endian problem with UDP multicasts (Closes: #406909)

      - Don't remap referenced versions for libraries that are not part of the
        runtime (like Npgsql, Novell.Directory.Ldap and Mono.* specially
        Mono.Cairo) because that makes predictable dependency tracking
        impossible for such libraries and is pretty insane as the remapped
        version must be 100% ABI compatible.
        This caused FTBFS for applications using Gtk# (which uses Mono.Cairo
        version 1.0) but runs and compiles (gmcs) under CLR 2.0.

        This new package should make specially embedded device users happy.
      - New package mono-jit-dbg, unstripped mono-jit
      - New package libmono0-dbg, unstripped libmono0
      - Add libgdiplus dependency to libmono-winforms{1,2}.0-cil, as it's only
        indirectly used via System.Drawing of libmono-system{1,2}.0-cil, which

      - Added Conflicts: mono-utils (<< 1.2.3.1-4) to libmono0, to aid partial
        upgrade of Mono from etch to lenny or sid, thanks to Rene Engelhard for
        the hints. (really Closes: #412970)
      - Moved binfmt-support dependency to recommends. (Closes: #418765)

    + This upload solves a dependency chain hell that made Mono not installable

      and blocking their migration to testing. Thus urgency=high.
      Unfortunately, I can't close any bugreports here, because there is none
      filed against Mono for this issue (yet).
    + Splitted left libraries of mono-classlib-1.0 and mono-classlib-2.0

  * New maintainer: Debian Mono maintainers <pkg-mono-devel@alioth.debian.org>
    after the previous maintainers stoped the work on it
  * Package descriptions written or improved
  * Library package separation to follow the shared libs conventions
    (libmono and libmono-profiler-... seem to belong together, though)
  * libmono-dev depends on libmint-dev since the last contains the headers and
    is available on all supported arches
  * Package renaming to avoid confusion (mono in mono-jit, mint in mono-mint)
  * merged binfmt-detector-cli and mono-common since they were already linked
    together and another 3kB package makes no much sense
  * limited the arch list to those officially supported by the Mono Project
  * Adapted the /usr/share/doc/mono-interpreter (now -mint) fixing hooks

mono (0.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Sorry I havn't been doing any CVS snapshots for
     a month. I'll try and sort something out.
  * Include a patch from Michel Danzer <daenzer@debian.org> to fix
     idiotic build failure on non-i386 arches.
  * Install /etc/mono/config and the manpage in the mono-common package,
     and add a replaces for smooth upgrades (mono-config.5 used to be in
     the mono-jit package).
  * Switch from setting prefix to DESTDIR so /etc works too.
  * Added some {}s to monoburg.y to make it parse correctly. Thanks to
     Zoltan Varga's message on mono-list.
  * Added data/config to the list of files that need to be cleaned 
     manually.

mono (0.13-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Pass --disable-shared to configure, and link mono-jit statically.
  * This turned out to be broken. Thanks to Dick Porter for putting up
     with me moaning about libtool combinations for a day, and for fixing
     it with the correct method I absolutely failed to see. Applied his
     patch for this, should hit CVS soon or I'll back it out.
  * Ship only a static libmono-dev for people interested in embedding.
     Shared lib is useless because the API is massively unstable.
  * Conflict the -dev with the old libmono0 until it is deemed useful
     again.
  * Change -a to -s in the binary-arch target so debhelper will only
     build arch-specific packages if they're available on the build arch.
  * Added mono-config.5 manpage to mono-jit package, and libmono.la and
     pkg-config/mono files to libmono-dev package.

mono (0.13-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Holiday maintainer upload. =)
  * Switched to pristine upstream source tarball.
  * Cleaned up debian/rules file, separated binary-arch/binary-indep
     targets for builds on other arches.
  * Stole the makefile magic from galeon (I did help write it =) to
     automatically run configure or autogen.sh depending on whether we're
     building from CVS or not, and then do the correct clean command
     later.
  * At the advice of Ximian folk, don't provide libmono0/libmono-dev for
     the moment - the API is unstable.
  * For when it does return... install the .a into libmono-dev and make
     it arch: any.
  * Include libmono.so.0 and libmono.so.0.0.0 into the mono-jit package.
     These will be returned to a seperate package, and headers and static
     libraries provided, when libmono's API is stable. To ease
     transition, added a Replaces: header.
  * Made mono-common arch: all, it contains no binaries currently.
  * Leave out cil-opcodes.xml unless someone complains.
  * Install documentation in mono-common, and have packages that depend
     on it symlink to there instead. Made mono depend directly on
     mono-common to prevent lintian griping about this. Added code to
     postinsts of mono, mono-jit and mono-interpreter remove their doc
     dir and replace it with a symlink on upgrades. Dpkg will not replace
     a directory with a symlink, even if it's empty.
  * Added -e to /bin/sh in the maintainer scripts.
  * Don't ship monostyle.1 and monoburg.1 manpages, the programs are in
     the mcs package and we don't ship them currently.
  * Added undocumented symlink for monograph.1.
  * Added rm to clean target for spare Makefiles left behind.
