  * debian/control
    debian/rules
    debian/libmono-nunit2.2-cil.install:
    + Added libmono-nunit2.2-cil package needed by packages like monodevelop
      and mono-tools, the nunit 2.4 API (libnunit2.4-cil) changed too much to
      port these packages. (thus urgency set to medium)
  * debian/shlibs.local:
    + Updated for the Mono 1.9 release (forgot this in -1).
  * debian/rules:
    debian/libmono-system2.0-cil.install:

  * debian/control:
    + Added libdiplus to dependencies of libmono-system-web1.0-cil and
      libmono-system-web2.0-cil as System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebColorConverter
      invokes it (which is needed by most web applications). (Closes: #479683)
    + Removed -1 revision of all Replaces lines with << as condition, as it's
      useless and makes backports and Ubuntu integration easier.
    + Added Conflicts on mono-classlib-{1,2}.0 (<< 1.1.13.6) and
      mono-classlib-{1,2}.0-dbg to ensure they are removed on all systems and
      the transition was finished long time ago.
  * debian/patches/fix_Dictionary_preventing_GC_r102114.dpatch:
    Clear empty slots in keySlots and valueSlots. Otherwise the garbage
    collector cannot reclaim the referenced key/value.

  * debian/patches/fix_TdsConnectionPool_svn.dpatch:
    + Don't leak connections in the pool, would cause an infinitely timeout.
    (patch taken from upstream SVN revisions 105424, 105432, 105433, 105719,
     106448 and 107325)
  * debian/libmono-system1.0-cil.clideps-override
    debian/libmono-system2.0-cil.clideps-override:
    + libcupsys2 package was renamed to libcups2, moving the dependeny on
      libcups2 to suggests (as it was before).
  * debian/rules:
    + Removed --list-missing from dh_install call, it's useless in the current
      implementation.
  * debian/patches/fix-mono-nunit.pc.in.dpatch:
    + Remove stupid relative path from prefix variable.

mono (1.2.6+dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=high

  * debian/mono-mcs.postinst
    debian/mono-1.0-devel.postinst:
    + Moved alternatives handling for cli-sn, cli-resgen and cli-al from
      mono-mcs to mono-1.0-devel, as mono-1.0-devel ships those applications
      (since mono 1.2.6+dfsg-1). (Closes: #460513)
      This caused FTBS for different source packages that didn't explicitly
      build-depend on mono-mcs, thus urgency set to high.
      (Thanks to Laurent Bigonville <bigon@bigon.be> for the investigation)
  * debian/mono-utils.postint
    debian/mono-utils.postinst:
    + Fixed file name.
  * debian/control:

    debian/patches/ppc_fix_flushing_of_icache_r92014.dpatch
    + Replaced ppc_disable_delegate_trampoline_optimization with
      ppc_fix_flushing_of_icache_r92014, as that one fixes instead of
      workarounds the PPC SIGILL issue (taken from upstream's SVN).

  * debian/patches/ppc_disable_delegate_trampoline_optimization.dpatch:
    + Disables delegate trampoline code for PPC, fixes instant SIGILL runtime
      crashes for every invoked application (as seen in PPC build logs of
      gtk-sharp2, gnome-sharp2 or beagle).
  * debian/patches/fix_threads.h.dpatch:
    + Don't include threads-type.h in threads.h and moved functions to the
      correct header, fixes compiling of OpenOffice.org's Mono bridge.
      (taken from upstream SVN revision 91687 + 91817)

  * debian/libmono-system-messaging{1,2}.0-cil.clideps-override
    debian/libmono-bytefx0.7.6.{1,2}-cil.clideps-override:
    + Added suggests libmono-winforms{1,2}.0-cil, doesn't make sense to pull in
      System.Windows.Forms for designer classes (which are only used by VS.NET)
  * debian/patches/fix_implicit_pointer_conversions.dpatch:
    + Fixed implicit pointer conversions by including a missing header, which
      caused FTBFS on IA64.
  * debian/control:
    + Added Homepage, Vcs-Svn and Vcs-Browser fields.
    + Updated Standards-Version to 3.7.3, no changes needed.

    debian/mono-2.0-devel.manpages:
    + Added mconfig
  * debian/control:
    + Added sparc and s390 to Architecture fields. (Closes: #332511, #377584)
      (as the last 3 feature-releases of Mono were able to build on sparc, and
       upstream is getting sparc port contributions again, it should be safe
       to enable sparc now)

  * New upstream release
    + Invoking GetFields on emitted type doesn't crash anymore, as seen with
      nemerle. (Closes: #452585)
  * debian/rules:
    + Updated MONO_API to 1.2.6
    + Enabled moonlight support in configure call.
    + Removed all "rm debian/tmp/usr/lib/mono/gac/"... calls, instead list
      libraries explicitly in .install files.
      (this is pretty error prone when upstream introduces new libraries and
       the rm list became way too long)
    + Copy various 1.0 manpages to 2.0 manpages for missing 2.0 manpages.
    + Remove +dfsg part in upstream version detection (UPVERSION variable).
  * debian/control:
    + Added new packages (mono-mcs/gmcs needed to be split as some parts of the
      runtime relies on the compiler, like the XmlSerializer class):
      - mono-mcs was split to: mono-1.0-devel and mono-1.0-service.
        (monolinker.exe is now shipped part of mono-1.0-devel, Closes: #443833)
      - mono-gmcs was split to: mono-2.0-devel, mono-2.0-service and
        mono-xbuild.
      - mono-smcs, containing the new compiler for moonlight/silverlight
        applications.

        moonlight/silverlight runtime libraries.
      - libmono-db2-1.0-cil, containing IBM DB2 database connector.
      - libmono-mozilla0.1-cil, containing the WebControl implementation using
        the Mozilla engine.
      - libmono-i18n1.0-cil and libmono-i18n2.0-cil, containing I18N libraries
        with code page definitions, moved from libmono-corlib{1,2}.0-cil.
      - prj2make-sharp, upstream moved distribution of prj2make-sharp to Mono.
    + libmono-corlib{1,2}.0-cil recommends libmono-i18n{1,2}.0-cil now.
    + Removed mono and mono-devel meta packages, as they are not useful for
      anyone.
  * debian/dh_clideps:
    + Synced from cli-common 0.5.3, needed for CLI 2.1 support.

mono (1.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The clean me harder and be nicer to embedded devices upload
  * Mirco 'meebey' Bauer:
    + New upstream release
      - Fixes endian problem with UDP multicasts (Closes: #406909)
    + debian/patches/dont_remap_non-runtime_libs.dpatch:
      - Don't remap referenced versions for libraries that are not part of the
        runtime (like Npgsql, Novell.Directory.Ldap and Mono.* specially
        Mono.Cairo) because that makes predictable dependency tracking
        impossible for such libraries and is pretty insane as the remapped
        version must be 100% ABI compatible.
        This caused FTBFS for applications using Gtk# (which uses Mono.Cairo
        version 1.0) but runs and compiles (gmcs) under CLR 2.0.
        (Closes: #425194)
    + debian/control:
      - New package mono-dbg, containing all debug sybols (*.mdb), which is
        27 MB for all libraries and applications of the mono source package.
        This new package should make specially embedded device users happy.
      - New package mono-jit-dbg, unstripped mono-jit
      - New package libmono0-dbg, unstripped libmono0
      - Add libgdiplus dependency to libmono-winforms{1,2}.0-cil, as it's only
        indirectly used via System.Drawing of libmono-system{1,2}.0-cil, which
        only suggests libgdiplus.
    + debian/rules:
      - Bumped MONO_API to 1.2.4
      - Install Mono.Data.Sqlite.dll.config
      - Enabled sigaltstack in ./configure call, since we use __thread / NPTL.
      - Call debian/dh_clifixperms in binary-indep target
      - Call debian/dh_clistrip in binary-indep target
    + debian/libmono-sqlite{1,2}.0-cil.install:

mono (1.1.13.6-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release
  * Mirco 'meebey' Bauer
    + This upload solves a dependency chain hell that made Mono not installable
      on all archs except i386 and amd64, this caused FTBFS for gtk-sharp and
      could also for dbus, avahi and probably other source packages, too,
      and blocking their migration to testing. Thus urgency=high.
      Unfortunately, I can't close any bugreports here, because there is none
      filed against Mono for this issue (yet).
    + Splitted left libraries of mono-classlib-1.0 and mono-classlib-2.0
      into own packages to avoid ABI breakages and meet the CLI Policy.
      All libraries in a package must have the same version number
      (required for versioned package names), see CLI Policy 0.4.0
      mono-classlib-1.0/2.0 are now empty transition packages.

    + debian/control:
      - Removed mono-classlib-1.0/2.0-dbg package
        Removed mono-assemblies-base package:
      - Changed mono-classlib-1.0/2.0 to have a minimum as depencies for the
        transition to avoid a dependency hell. (Closes: #360996)
        All packages that have a binary dependency on
        mono-classlib-1.0/2.0 should be rebuild!
      - Removed pnet-compiler Build-Conflicts and Conflicts.
      - Updated libgdiplus dependency of libmono-winforms1.0/2.0-cil

    + Remoting is fast again with 1.1.6
      (Closes: #303349)
  * Mirco 'meebey' Bauer
    + Upstream merged mcs and mono into one mono tarball, this makes the
      build process a lot easier.
    + Dropping /usr/share/dotnet structure with this release, upstream
      provides now a FHS conform solution.
    + Added versioned mono-common dependency to mono, makes lintian happy.
    + Added cli-common to build-dependencies.
    + Added transition code to mono-common.postinst for moving
      /usr/share/dotnet/mono to /usr/lib/mono
      (thanks to Ingo Saitz aka Salz for helping with this)
    + Added c-sharp-compiler, resource-file-generator, assembly-linker,
      strong-name-tool, global-assembly-cache-tool and cil-disassembler
      alternatives (those are common CLI programs).
    + Added mono-devel metapackage.
    + Added mono-common dependecy to all related packages.
    + Removed a lot of hacks in debian/rules, not required anymore.
    + Removed old Conflicts/Replaces.
    + Removed icu28-dev from buil-dependencies (ICU is not recommended by
      upstream anymore, and does break things).
    + Added pkg-config to "Recommends" of mono-mcs. (Closes: #294606)
    + created 07_no_libc_fun.dpatch
      (Mono 1.1.x tries to use internal libc symbols, which is not required)

mono (1.0.5-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Mirco 'meebey' Bauer
    + removed mono-mint package and all packages for s390.
      The mono-mint (the interpeter) is deprecated, unmaintained upstream
      and was just a proof-of-concept programm.
      The mono-jit is no longer supported for s390 by upstream in the stable
      release and has a lot of bugs on that arch. This prevents Mono to enter
      "testing", thus removed.

  * limited the arch list to those officially supported by the Mono Project

  * Include a patch from Michel Danzer <daenzer@debian.org> to fix
     idiotic build failure on non-i386 arches.
  * Install /etc/mono/config and the manpage in the mono-common package,
     and add a replaces for smooth upgrades (mono-config.5 used to be in
     the mono-jit package).
  * Switch from setting prefix to DESTDIR so /etc works too.
  * Added some {}s to monoburg.y to make it parse correctly. Thanks to
     Zoltan Varga's message on mono-list.
  * Added data/config to the list of files that need to be cleaned 
     manually.

  * Pass --disable-shared to configure, and link mono-jit statically.
  * This turned out to be broken. Thanks to Dick Porter for putting up
     with me moaning about libtool combinations for a day, and for fixing
     it with the correct method I absolutely failed to see. Applied his
     patch for this, should hit CVS soon or I'll back it out.
  * Ship only a static libmono-dev for people interested in embedding.
     Shared lib is useless because the API is massively unstable.
  * Conflict the -dev with the old libmono0 until it is deemed useful
     again.
  * Change -a to -s in the binary-arch target so debhelper will only
     build arch-specific packages if they're available on the build arch.
  * Added mono-config.5 manpage to mono-jit package, and libmono.la and
     pkg-config/mono files to libmono-dev package.

mono (0.13-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Holiday maintainer upload. =)
  * Switched to pristine upstream source tarball.
  * Cleaned up debian/rules file, separated binary-arch/binary-indep
     targets for builds on other arches.
  * Stole the makefile magic from galeon (I did help write it =) to
     automatically run configure or autogen.sh depending on whether we're
     building from CVS or not, and then do the correct clean command
     later.
  * At the advice of Ximian folk, don't provide libmono0/libmono-dev for
     the moment - the API is unstable.
  * For when it does return... install the .a into libmono-dev and make
     it arch: any.
  * Include libmono.so.0 and libmono.so.0.0.0 into the mono-jit package.
     These will be returned to a seperate package, and headers and static
     libraries provided, when libmono's API is stable. To ease
     transition, added a Replaces: header.
  * Made mono-common arch: all, it contains no binaries currently.
  * Leave out cil-opcodes.xml unless someone complains.
  * Install documentation in mono-common, and have packages that depend
     on it symlink to there instead. Made mono depend directly on
     mono-common to prevent lintian griping about this. Added code to
     postinsts of mono, mono-jit and mono-interpreter remove their doc
     dir and replace it with a symlink on upgrades. Dpkg will not replace
     a directory with a symlink, even if it's empty.
  * Added -e to /bin/sh in the maintainer scripts.
  * Don't ship monostyle.1 and monoburg.1 manpages, the programs are in
     the mcs package and we don't ship them currently.
  * Added undocumented symlink for monograph.1.
  * Added rm to clean target for spare Makefiles left behind.
